It should be noted that although the purpose of the scale is similar to that of the adult Braden Scale and Braden-Q scale for older children, the scoring methodology is completely different, particularly that a high score is associated with high risk, the opposite from these other Braden scales where a low score equates to high risk.

The Neonatal Skin Risk Assessment Scale (NSRAS) should only be used to assess nenoates under 21 days of age.">
