The growth velocity will usually be positive, especially in childhood, although there may be circumstances where it is neccessary to record a negative velocity, for example in situations of loss of height with age.">

Not to be used to record the actual change in measurements over actual, identified time periods for body length/height, head circumference and body weight. Use the interval event model and the 'Change' mathematical function in appropriate OBSERVATION archetypes for this purpose - OBSERVATION.height, OBSERVATION.head_circumference or OBSERVATION.body_weight.">
