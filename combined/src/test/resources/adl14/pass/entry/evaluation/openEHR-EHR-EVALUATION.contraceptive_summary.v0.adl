This archetype is to be used to record information about both current and previous use of contraception.

The specific scope of this archetype is on overall documentation about the use of all types of contraception throughout a woman's lifetime, including episodes where more than one type of contraception may have been used simultaneously. 

The 'Per type' cluster of data elements allows for recording of specific details and episodes about each type of contraception used and can be repeated only once per type. The list of contraception types listed in the 'Per type' run-time name constraint identifies each category of contraception. This name constraint can be applied during template modelling or at run-time within a software application.

In many situations the individual will use only one type of contraception at a time. However, if other types of contraception are used at the same time, the details will be recorded in another instance of the 'Per type' cluster.

For each type of contraception the history of use over time can be captured using the repeatable 'Per episode' cluster. This cluster of data elements allows for a very detailed pattern of contraception use to be recorded, if necessary. 

Use to incorporate the narrative descriptions of contraceptive history within existing or legacy clinical systems into an archetyped format, using the 'Overall description' data element.">
