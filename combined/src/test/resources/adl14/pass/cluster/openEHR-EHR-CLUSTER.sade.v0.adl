Designed to be optionally nested within the CLUSTER.exam_tympanic_membrane archetype to provide additional detail on tympanic membrane retraction, if it is useful within a given clinical scenario.

This archetype extends the Sade Classification to allow recording of 'No visible retraction' where applicable.
Sade Stage 5 (spontaneous perforation) is described in some documentation but is not described in the original paper and appears not to be in common usage.">
