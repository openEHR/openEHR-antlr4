This list can be comprised of three types of statements, each represented by specific archetypes:
- statements about the positive presence of immunisations administered are recorded using the ACTION.medication OR
- statements about the positive exclusion of immunisations administered  can be recorded using the specific EVALUATION.exclusion-global ; OR
- statements about no information being available - neither a positive presence of an immunisation administered nor a positive exclusion - can be recorded using the EVALUATION.absence archetype.">
