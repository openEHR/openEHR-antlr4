This archetype will be contain combinations of planned activities, activies that are in progress or have been carried out, goals/objectives, targets, and recommendations.

This care plan may include:
- the order and activity status for the care plan as a whole, using INSTRUCTION.care_plan_request and ACTION.care_plan;
- the order for each of the proposed activities, for example INSTRUCTION.service_request or INSTRUCTION.health_education_request; 
- the corresponding ACTION archetypes for each activity, which will indicate the status of each order - for example those that are planned, in progress, completed or cancelled; and
- optionally, instances of EVALUATION.goal to record the overall goal of the care plan and/or clinical targets for each of activities.

The SECTION.care_plan archetype is an example of a framework for clinical content that could be used within this archetype.">
