| Object representing annotations on an archetype. These can be of various forms, with a documentation f
| orm defined so far, which has a multi-level tabular structure 
| [ [ [String value, String key], path key], language key]. 
| Example instance, showing the documentation structure.
|  
|      documentation = <
|          ["en"] = <
|             ["/data[id2]"] = <
|                 ["ui"] = <"passthrough">
|             >
|             ["/data[id2]/items[id3]"] = <
|                 ["design note"] = <"this is a design note on Statement">
|                 ["requirements note"] = <"this is a requirements note on Statement">
|                 ["medline ref"] = <"this is a medline ref on Statement">
|             >
|          >
|      >
|  Other sub-structures might have different keys, e.g. based on programming languages, UI toolkits etc.
