|
| The concept of a named folder.
|
| Note: It is strongly recommended that the inherited attribute uid be populated in top-level
|       (i.e. tree-root) `FOLDER` objects, using the UID copied from the `object_id()` of the `uid` field of
|       the enclosing `VERSION` object.
|       For example, the `ORIGINAL_VERSION.uid 87284370-2D4B-4e3d-A3F3-F303D2F4F34B::uk.nhs.ehr1::2` would
|       be copied to the `uid` field of the top `FOLDER` object.
