|
| Content of one version in a `VERSIONED_COMPOSITION`. A Composition is considered the unit of
| modification of the record, the unit of transmission in record Extracts, and the unit of 
| attestation by authorising clinicians. In this latter sense, it may be considered equivalent 
| to a signed document.
|
| Note: It is strongly recommended that the inherited attribute uid be populated in Compositions, 
|       using the UID copied from the object_id() of the uid field of the enclosing VERSION object.
|       For example, the `ORIGINAL_VERSION.uid 87284370-2D4B-4e3d-A3F3-F303D2F4F34B::uk.nhs.ehr1::2`
|       would be copied to the uid field of the Composition.
|

    |
    | Uuid of this Composition.
    |
    prop uid : UID_BASED_ID ;

    |
    | Mandatory indicator of the localised language in which this Composition is written. 
    | Coded from openEHR Code Set `languages`. The language of an Entry if different from 
    | the Composition is indicated in `ENTRY.language`.
    |
    prop language: CODE_PHRASE «iso.iso_639-1» ;

    |
    | Name of territory in which this Composition was written. Coded from openEHR countries 
    | code set, which is an expression of the ISO 3166 standard.
    |
    prop territory: CODE_PHRASE «iso.iso_3166-1-alpha2» ;

    |
    | Temporal category of this Composition, i.e.
    |
    | * 431|persistent| - of potential life-time validity;
    | * 451|episodic| - valid over the life of a care episode;
    | * 433|event| - valid at the time of recording (long-term validity requires subsequent 
    |   clinical assessment).
    |
    | or any other code defined in the openEHR terminology group 'category'.

    prop category : DV_CODED_TEXT «openEHR.Composition_category» ;

    |
    | The person primarily responsible for the content of the Composition (but not 
    | necessarily its committal into the EHR system). This is the identifier which 
    | should appear on the screen. It may or may not be the person who entered the 
    | data. When it is the patient, the special self instance of PARTY_PROXY will be used.
    |
    prop composer : PARTY_PROXY ;

    |
    | The clinical session context of this Composition, i.e. the contextual attributes 
    | of the clinical session..
    |
    prop context :? EVENT_CONTEXT ;

    |
    | The content of this Composition.
